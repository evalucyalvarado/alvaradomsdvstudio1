The primarily blue and black poster is printed on white paper and features two superimposed photographs of Hampton, a Hampton quotation, and biographic information about Hampton. In the bottom right quadrant of the photograph is a large close-up, blue-and-white photograph of Hampton. He is wearing a dark tone jacket over a dark turtleneck with a white stripe across the center of the turtleneck collar and a black fur cap with a brim. Hampton’s chin is tilted upwards, he is looking into the distance towards the left edge of the poster, and he appears to be speaking. Superimposed over this image, in the bottom right corner, is a second, smaller, black-and-white image of Hampton. He is shown in profile, facing the left edge of the poster, and is speaking into a freestanding microphone directly in front of him. His proper right arm is raised, and he is pointing with his index finger. He is wearing a medium tone, sherpa lined jacket over a light tone V-neck sweater. Printed over his proper left jacket lapel is diagonal black text that reads [I AM A REVOLUTIONARY]. The larger image of Hampton is accented by blue rays radiating from around the outline of his head. In the top left corner, within a band of black, is diagonally printed blue block text that reads [\"YOU CAN JAIL A REVOLUTIONARY, / BUT YOU CAN’T JAIL THE / REVOLUTION. YOU CAN RUN A / FREEDOM FIGHTER AROUND THE / COUNTRY BUT YOU CAN’T RUN FREEDOM / FIGHTING AROUND THE COUNTRY. YOU / CAN MURDER A LIBERATOR, / BUT YOU CAN’T MURDER LIBERATION\"]. Printed in the bottom left corner is diagonal blue text that reads, [Fred Hampton Deputy / Chairman Illinois Chapter / Black Panther Party / Born August 30, 1948 / Murdered By Fascist Pigs / Dec. 4, 1969]. The poster has a thin white frame along the top and side edges. The bottom of the frame is wider and features printed black text in the bottom right corner that reads, [PHONE NO. / 312 / 243-8276 / 738-0778] and [BLACK PANTHER PARTY / 2350 W .MADISON(sic) ST. / CHICAGO ,ILLINOIS(sic) / 60612].
